Next Steps
If you want to dive in:

Assemble or clean your dataset; confirm it’s ready for tokenization.
Prototype a smaller model to ensure your training pipeline works.
Scale up to the architecture you really want (e.g., ~6B, ~13B).
Evaluate the model thoroughly—perplexity, downstream tasks, etc.
Fine‑tune for alignment or instruction use cases.
Once you have a handle on these steps, we can push the envelope with more advanced experiments: mixture-of-experts, multi-modal inputs, specialized training schedules. I’m always here to swap ideas or help refine details—just let me know your next question or challenge!
