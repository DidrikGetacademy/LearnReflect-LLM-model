Gradient checkpointing: Checkpoints parts of the computation graph so that intermediate activations are recomputed on the fly instead of stored.

Low precision (FP16/BF16) or 8‑bit techniques to reduce memory usage for weights and gradients.


CPU offloading: Swapping out parts of the model to CPU RAM when not in use, though the i9‑9900K’s system memory bandwidth will become a bottleneck.


very small batch sizes: Possibly in the single digits or even micro‑batching (batch size = 1).


Engineering Complexity: Multi-modal or advanced gating methods add complexity to the training pipeline and inference stack.

software: ZeRO, FSDP

 DeepSpeed or FSDP

Stability: Employ well-known techniques (RMSNorm, proper initialization) so the model trains reliably.

 Efficiency: Integrate advanced attention mechanisms (like FlashAttention, xformers kernels) to speed up training/inference.

 SOTA-ish: Incorporate some improvements that researchers have been exploring (Rotary embeddings, ALiBi, maybe gating or mixtures of experts).

 Integrate a memory-efficient attention kernel (e.g., FlashAttention 2, xformers) to handle large sequences more efficiently and reduce GPU memory usage


 Scalability: Target a parameter count and structure that can push SOTA performance across multiple domains (code, reasoning, multi‑step problem solving).

 Efficiency & Hardware Awareness: Acknowledge real limits (GPU memory, throughput). Incorporate advanced attention mechanisms and parallelization.

 Alignment & Multi‑Modal: Consider expansions to multi‑modal input (images, audio) or advanced instruction alignment.

 Robustness & Reasoning: Incorporate inductive biases or architectural tweaks that encourage better logical reasoning and fewer hallucinations.


 Mixed precision

Gradient Checkpointing: Saves VRAM at runtime.
Distributed Training: Tools like DeepSpeed or FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP) can shard weights across GPUs.

FlashAttention or xformers: Efficient attention kernels for large sequence lengths
Gradient Checkpointing: Saves VRAM at runtime.


Finetuning: 
Instruction Data: Fine‑tune on curated examples of question‑answer pairs, summaries, instructions, etc.
Chain-of-Thought: Provide step‑by‑step reasoning in the training examples to help the model learn more robust reasoning patterns.
RLHF (Optional): If you can, incorporate a reward model to guide the final alignment process—this adds a layer of “human preference” refinement.

Log Everything: Use tools like Weights & Biases or TensorBoard to track metrics.

Checkpoint Often: Save intermediate checkpoints. That way, if you see a dip in performance, you can roll back to a known good state.

AutoML / Hyper‑Param Tuning: If you have the compute, you can systematically experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, warmup schedules, etc.
